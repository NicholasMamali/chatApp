# chatApp
design and implement a client-server based chat
application that makes use of TCP sockets. You need to specify your own application
layer protocol to support the client-server architecture, and then implement a chat server
that will manage the interaction between chatting clients. You should also implement a
chat client that will allow one or more pairs of users to run on different hosts and exchange
messages in real-time. The clientâ€™s interface can be in terminal, with appropriate user
menus.
